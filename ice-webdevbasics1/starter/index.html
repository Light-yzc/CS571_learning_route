		<ol>
			<li><strong> Meat with Vegetables: </strong>In a large pot, cook the ground beef, diced onion, and diced bell pepper over medium heat until the meat is no longer pink and the vegetables are softened.
			</li>
			<li><strong> Add Remaining Ingredients:</strong> To the pot, add the kidney beans, diced tomatoes (with their juice), chili powder, ground cumin, and salt to taste. If the chili is too thick, add a little water to reach your desired consistency.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Simmer: </strong> Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally.
